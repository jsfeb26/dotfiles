# wtree: Create a new worktree for each given branch.
# Usage: wtree [ -p|--pnpm | -n|--npm ] branch1 branch2 ...
#
# This function does the following:
#   1. Parses command-line arguments; if -p/--pnpm is provided, it will later run "pnpm install".
#   2. Determines the current branch and repository root.
#   3. Uses a fixed parent directory (~/dev) to house all worktree directories.
#   4. For each branch passed:
#        - If the branch does not exist, it is created from the current branch.
#        - It checks that a worktree for that branch does not already exist.
#        - It then creates a worktree in ~/dev using a naming convention: <repoName>-<branch>.
#        - If the install-deps flag is true, it runs "pnpm install" inside the new worktree.
#        - Finally, it either opens the new worktree via the custom "cursor" command (if defined)
#          or prints its path.
